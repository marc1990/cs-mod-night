# Cities Skylines Night mod

Current state: Work In progress

Feel free to help.

Features:
- Add head lights
- Add rear lights, only one the car is slow driving
- Add lights to build props(Currently not working)
- Add street lights, two-lane only
- Darken the sun -> is controlled by Moving Sun from rmbackslash

Perfomance is good after load. I hit about 30-60fps with R9 280x which is about the same without the mod.


Know issus:
- When the mod is staterd the framerate drops because all street lights are added.
- Sometimes light flicker because of max number of lights
- Not tested with other mods
